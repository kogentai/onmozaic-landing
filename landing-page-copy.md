Hero Image/Visual Idea: A split-screen visual. Left side: A complex natural language prompt regarding sensitive financial data. Right side: A perfectly architected DAG and pristine dbt code, overlaid with multiple "Verified Compliant: SOC2/GDPR" certification badges and a green "Dry Run Successful" indicator.

[The Problem / Agitation Section]
H2 Headline: The "Approval Gap" is Paralyzing Your Data Strategy.
Body Copy:
Business velocity demands data immediately. Engineering reality demands stability, compliance, and rigorous cost control. The gap between these needs is where data teams burn out.
Generic AI coding assistants are fast, but they are "black boxes"—reckless with governance, blind to context, and prone to generating unmaintainable spaghetti code. You cannot deploy their output to a regulated production environment without rewriting it.
The result? Your highest-value engineers are trapped doing repetitive plumbing, and stakeholders are forced into shadow IT.
[The Solution: The "Trust Loop"]
H2 Headline: Autonomous Execution. Principal-Level Standards. Introducing the Mozaic Trust Loop.
Intro Copy:
Mozaic is not a simple code assistant. It is an autonomous engineering agent designed with a zero-trust security architecture. It is mathematically incapable of touching your production environment without first proving its work. We call this The Trust Loop.
[Four-Column Feature Block with Icons]
1. Organizational Context
(Icon: Brain with network connections)
Mozaic doesn't just parse syntax; it understands intent. It ingests your Organizational Memory—absorbing your specific architectural patterns, business logic definitions, and technology standards before planning any action.
2. Isolated Dry-Run Simulation
(Icon: A reinforced containment box)
Mozaic executes the proposed architecture in an ephemeral, completely isolated sandbox using anonymized data. It verifies schema integrity, runs compliance checks, and ensures functional stability. Zero risk exposure.
3. Forensic Impact & Cost Analysis
(Icon: Magnifying glass over a ledger)
Eliminate surprises. Before approval, Mozaic provides a forensic report detailing exact lineage changes, flagging potential downstream breakage, and calculating precise pre-flight cloud costs.
4. The Executive Approval Gateway
(Icon: A secure shield with a biometric scan aesthetic)
Ultimate authority remains with your team. Technical leads review fully inspectable artifacts—clean SQL, structured dbt models—and authorize deployment with a single click, knowing the due diligence is complete.
[Dual Persona Benefits Section]
H2 Headline: A Unified Platform for Technical Authority and Strategic Speed.
[Left Column: For Engineering Leaders]
H3: The Ultimate Force Multiplier for Your Senior Talent.
Your data architects shouldn't be writing boilerplate. Mozaic handles the massive volume of foundational engineering with the precision of a principal engineer, freeing your team for high-leverage architecture.
Flawless, Inspectable Artifacts: No black boxes. Mozaic generates standardized, highly readable SQL and dbt models ready for immediate git commit and rigorous peer review.
Autonomous Heavy Lifting: Delegate entire end-to-end workflows—from complex ingestion to staging models and transformations—knowing the output will meet your exacting standards.
Governance Hardcoded: PII detection, naming conventions, and access controls are intrinsic to the generation process, not retrofitted after the fact.
[Right Column: For Business Stakeholders]
H3: Strategic Agility Without Technical Debt.
Product owners and analysts need rapid insights to compete, but speed cannot come at the cost of stability or compliance.
Natural Language Infrastructure: Initiate sophisticated projects—integrating new regulated data sources or building cross-functional data marts—simply by describing the business need.
Radical Transparency: Understand the precise scope, impact, and cost of your data requests before they are built.
Unblock Innovation: Achieve 10x faster time-to-insight on complex requests without bypassing the necessary engineering guardrails.
[Capabilities / "The Stack" Section]
H2 Headline: End-to-End Automation for the Complicated Data Stack.
Body Copy: Mozaic integrates seamlessly into sophisticated modern data stacks, expertly managing the lifecycle of complex data.
Intelligent Ingestion: Autonomously map complex schemas from sources like Salesforce or Workday, instantly flagging sensitive data and generating resilient incremental load logic.
Production-Grade Modeling: Generates multi-layer dbt projects (staging, intermediate, marts) complete with comprehensive data quality tests and documentation.
Proactive Optimization: An autonomous agent that constantly profiles high-cost queries, proactively engineering partitioning and clustering strategies to slash infrastructure spend.
Enterprise Orchestration: Automatically integrates validated pipelines into your existing Airflow, Prefect, or dbt Cloud schedules.
